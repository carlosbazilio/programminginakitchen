## Assignment 

![](../assets/atribuicao.jpeg)

Assignment is a computer programming operation that assigns a value to a variable (something that has a noun and an associated value). In the kitchen, a similar operation occurs when we fill a bowl with something like water or milk. This metaphor is not as perfect as we would like it to be. In computer programming, an assignment is a copy of a value from one place to another. In the kitchen, when we fill a bowl, we may be draining out another. In the kitchen, a copy of food is expensive. In computer programming, it is costless.

In the kitchen, we could have:

~~~~~~~~
    1: bowl <- flour, milk, eggs, sugar 
    2: mix (bowl) 
    3: tray <- bowl
~~~~~~~~

In the example above, the assignment operations occur at lines 1 and 3.

Based on a suggestion from my student, we could change the metaphor and think about the **temperature** of food. When we fill a bowl with hot water from another bowl, for a moment, they will share the same temperature. This replication is exactly what happens when we do an assignment in computer programming.
