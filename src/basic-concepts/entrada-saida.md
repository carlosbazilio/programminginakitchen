In computer programming, input and output operations are essential for creating interactive computer programs. For instance, we cannot imagine how an ATM could work without asking for identification, passwords, showing available balances, returning money, and so on. In the kitchen, an order and the required ingredients to prepare it are regarded as input data. The plate prepared, like the dish of the day, is the output. Although recipe preparation is the most important part of this process, like the execution of a computer program, input and output are fundamental for providing the inputs and consuming the outputs.
