## Parameters / Arguments

![](../assets/parametros.jpg)

Every recipe indicates how many people it serves. This amount is related to the number of ingredients used. If we want to prepare this recipe for a different number of people, most of the time we just have to change the quantities proportionally. These values are called parameters or arguments[^params] of the recipe. In computer programming, the same happens. Programs have parameters, which means that the same program can produce different results depending on the input values.

[^params]: Regarding math or computer programming functions, **arguments** are the values used when calling a function, whereas **parameters** are the identifiers a function uses to receive the passed values.
