## Exceptions

![](../assets/excecoes.jpeg)

In the kitchen, when we prepare a recipe, sometimes the result is not what it is supposed to be. It can be caused by a stove that is not working properly, an ingredient that is not as fresh as we desire, or some distraction during the preparation. In such cases, we try to recover by making a different preparation. For instance, when preparing a perfect boiled egg, the result could not be what we expected, but we can reuse this egg to make another preparation. In computer programming, exceptions are situations that we do not desire but that can occur. In such cases, we code operations that will change the objective of the code.
