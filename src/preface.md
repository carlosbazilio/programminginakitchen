# Preface

Popular wisdom says a man has a complete life when he plants a tree, writes a book, and has a child. I think this sentence must be analysed in a more abstract way. When we plant a tree, we care about our environment. When we have a child, we love unconditionally. By writing a book, we share and endorse knowledge.

Recently, I've read a book written by the Brazilian professor Mario Sergio Cortella ("Pensar bem nos faz bem!"). He argues that books were the first distance education platform. I think this definition is awesome! I've taught courses for many years, and the distance ones have far-reaching use. Books do indeed have this power.

Writers also attract me. It seems too difficult to write something good without being an expert. Computer science is a subject that changes a lot. So, being an expert requires hard and continuous work. I do not know how expert I am, but I decided to publish this book when I realized my notes deserved to be shared. In fact, I even do not know whether this subject is exhausted, but it is already worth reading.

In my classes, I use metaphors a lot. They are a wonderful learning resource since any complex idea can be depicted using basic notions from a student point of view. In 2012, I attended an international conference where I met professor Mary Lynn Manns. She gave me her book called [Pedagogical Patterns](http://www.pedagogicalpatterns.org "Title"). This book has a collection of pedagogical patterns selected by professors all around the world. (*Consistent Metaphor*) is a metaphor presented in this book, and it made me feel happy because I had never thought about a theory behind what I did naturally. This book has a collection of metaphors for programming learners and teachers. We adopt kitchens as an environment for creating these metaphors.

We looked forward to similar approaches to ours. Three related ideas were found: (i) a video lecture made by professor Tanzeela Ali, from Superior University in Pakistan, entitled ["From Psychology to Logic - Learning Computer Programming in the Kitchen"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya3fjj3ewUU); (ii) a website with metaphors for web programming ["Code Analogies"](https://www.codeanalogies.com/); (iii) a video lecture made by Gabriel Froes and Vanessa Weber entitled ["Programando na Cozinha"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcXpOcF-T6k) which relates cooking and programming activities. Although the last video is just a guide to cooking a recipe, the video's description contains the recipe written in PHP (a language for web page creation, like the page in our book).

In this book, a developer is a chef who knows ordinary and extraordinary recipes, such that he can invent his own. Bon app√©tit, i.e., enjoy programming!
